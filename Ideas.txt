Possible objectives:
- Select best model for the dataset
- Define the appropriate premium
- Compute reserves

Possible steps:
- 80% train, 20% test
- Use Regression models to predict annual medical bills covered by health insurance.
- Find the most informative feature(s). (Variable selection, Penalized methods)
- Detect outliers
- Regression trees
- Neural Networks

Objectives:
- Predict costs with features
- Select important features
- Design a web page for possible clients of the health insurance. It could contain 2-3 questions.

Attention:
- In the report, I need to specify the model used in the code (see ppts for reference).
- Gaussian Linear Models, Generalized Linear Models, LSE
- Goodness of fit
